                    <p><a href="https://cantwait.ideo.com" target="_blank">IDEO</a> is a global design consulting firm; I interned at IDEO's Tokyo studio from the beginning of September to late December 2022. Due to the confidential nature of my work during this internship, I cannot divulge any specific details about my projects or clients until that information is publicly released by IDEO, at which point I will update this page. However, what I can share is that I was heavily involved in the following: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Synthesizing user and expert interviews and uncovering design insights and opportunity areas</li>
                            <li>Producing interactive prototypes of various fidelities for mobile and web</li>
                            <li>Running brainstorming and design thinking workshops</li>
                            <li>Building trust with clients by involving and updating them regularly</li>
                            <li>Preparing and presenting decks to share progress and learnings with colleagues and clients</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        The main thing this experience taught me was how to wear multiple hats and adjust to the team's needs at any given moment, especially since the teams I was a part of were quite small (3-4 people). Regardless of job titles and descriptions, it felt like everyone was involved in a little bit of everything. Thanks to this, I was able to gain a lot of experience not just in interaction design but in design research and strategy. I was also fortunate to have team members who encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone.
