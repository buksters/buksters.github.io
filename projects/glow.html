                <h2>Overview and role</h2>
                <p>In the height of the pandemic, many performance venues were shut down and there was uncertainty when - or if - they would open back up. With this uncertainty in mind, we conceptualized Glow: a livestreaming platform that makes concert experiences memorable, not in spite of, but because of them being virtual. I worked on this with two other team members; all three of us were equally active in the user research, synthesis, and ideation phases but we split up responsibilities once we started prototyping. I focused mainly on interactions during the performance.

                            <h2>User research</h2>
                            <p>To better understand the needs of our potential users, namely college students and young professionals who used to regularly attend concerts in-person, we decided to conduct user interviews. First, we compiled a list of questions and activities that would give us insight into what aspects of the concert experience are most important to them. Using this protocol, each team member recruited interviewees in the aforementioned demographic and conducted their own interviews.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>One finding from our research synthesis was that interaction--both amongst audience members and between the audience and the performer--was a common value in our participants and a big area of apprehension when considering livestreamed performances. Another finding was that while virtual concerts require much less effort to attend, that contributed to a lack of atmosphere and excitement for the performance. We started asking ourselves, how can we make users feel more invested and build up anticipation for the livestream without compromising on the convenience?</p>

                <h2>Not a solitary experience</h2>
                <p>After several rounds of brainstorming, we came up with the concept of giving each user a "glow" - a virtual presence in the form of a glowing aura. Glow allows for interactions that are unique to a virtual platform while creating a shared atmosphere that reminds concert-goers that they are not alone in the experience, even if they are not physically together. It also doesn't require users to turn on their cameras in order to create this feeling of togetherness.</p>

                            <p>Users can interact with the performer by sending their glow, which shows up in the performer's background, allowing the user to become a part of the performance.
