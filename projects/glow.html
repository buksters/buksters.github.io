                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In the height of the pandemic, many performance venues were shut down and there was uncertainty when - or if - they would open back up. With this uncertainty in mind, we conceptualized Glow: a livestreaming platform that makes concert experiences memorable, not in spite of, but because of them being virtual.  
                </p>

                            <h2>User research</h2>
                            <p>To better understand the needs of our potential users, namely college students and young professionals who used to regularly attend concerts in-person, we each recruited interviewees in this demographic and conducted our own interviews. We followed a protocol in which we compiled a list of questions and activities that would give us insight into what aspects of the concert experience are most important to them.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>One finding from our research synthesis was that interaction - both amongst audience members and between the audience and the performer - was a common value in our participants and a big area of apprehension when considering livestreamed performances. A particularly interesting point was that the lack of energy required to attend virtual performances - several people mentioned that they would put it on in the background while doing other things - was construed as both a plus and minus. While it allows for more flexibility and spontaneity, it also contributed to a lack of atmosphere and excitement for the performance. We knew that this duality needed to be addressed - how can we make users feel more invested and excited for the livestream without compromising on the convenience?</p>

                <h2>Not a solitary experience</h2>
                <p>After several rounds of brainstorming, we came up with the concept of giving each user a "glow" - a virtual presence in the form of a glowing dot. Glow allows for interactions that are unique to a virtual platform while creating a shared atmosphere that reminds concert-goers that they are not alone in the experience, even if they are not physically together. It also doesn't require users to turn on their cameras in order to create this feeling of togetherness.</p>

                            <p>Glow allows users to be seen and heard, like how one might try to accomplish by bringing glow sticks of certain colors or screaming "I LOVE YOU" at the top of their lungs during a concert. Users can match the color of their glows to their own mood or the mood of a song, and they can send out comments that are visible to other users and even the performer.</p>
