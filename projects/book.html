                    <h2>Overview</h2>  
                    <p>School libraries often have workspaces that serve as great study spots. During peak hours, however, finding an open space can be time and energy-consuming. In order to make finding a place to study less stressful for students, I conceptualized Book, a workspace reservation app for easy availability checking and booking in the MIT libraries.</p>

                    <h2>User research and synthesis</h2>  
                    <p>To build a better understanding of how students view workspaces in the university libraries and how they approach finding one, I conducted 5 one-on-one interviews with MIT students. When recruiting research participants, I was mindful of getting a diverse range in class years and frequency in which they use the libraries.
                    <br><br>
                    From the interviews, it became evident that students using library workspaces largely fell under one of three categories: 1. those doing individual work who prefer to sit alone, 2. those doing individual work who prefer to sit with friends, and 3. those doing group work. Several pain points also came to light, identified below.

                    <p>
                    Based on the findings, I defined my project goal: <b>an app that allows busy students, who have varying needs and preferences, to intuitively find and secure library workspaces that match their needs</b>. I then started thinking about the app's structure and actions.

                    For instance, allowing students to specify preferences and needs, and then automatically assigning them a workspace that fits their criteria, matching solo students and groups to their respective intended study spaces. Overall, the goal was to streamline the process of finding and reserving a workspace for all user types. The user flow for booking a workspace is shown below.
                
                    Additionally, an experimental feature of Book is the ability to make study groups "public" to other students when booking a group workspace, allowing other students to join. This streamlines the process of creating, scheduling, and finding study groups.

                    <p>I went for a play on words here, given that Book is a workspace booking system in a setting filled with books. Formed by 7 lines, it's a simple logo with a unique feature - by shifting 2 lines, the book transforms into a desk. These two symbols represent the purpose of the app, which is why I animated the splash screen to showcase this transformation.</p>
