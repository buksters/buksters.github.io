                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p> Our society is one of mass production and mass waste, which is destroying the planet. How do we get consumers to care more about increasing the lifespan of their material goods when words aren't enough? To change the mindset of objects being disposable and replaceable? </p>
                    <p> Introducing Critter, an installation that explores how a user’s relationship with a household object, and how they treat it, might change if the object could express and defend itself.</p>

                <div class="caption">
                    <h2>Inspiration and ideation</h2>
                    <p> Reconsidering how we treat objects is not a new concept. During the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)">Constructivism</a> movement of the early 20th century, the idea of “object-as-comrade” was born: viewing objects as equals, comrades, rather than as commodities that we simply possess. This perspective led to an emergence in new approaches and mindsets for designing everyday objects in 1920s Russia. Today, a century later, I think that approach towards objects is still, if not even more relevant, which gave me inspiration for this project. Taking "object-as-comrade" a bit more literally, I asked myself how lifelike elements and behaviors could aid in an object's self-preservation.</p>

                                <h2>How it works</h2>
                                <p>Critter relies on pathos for protection, with its first line of defense being its anthropomorphic appearance consisting of a head with large eyes that stare upwards at you. </p>

                    <p> As with any other timer, it emits an alarm to notify users when a certain amount of time has elapsed. This can be turned off by pressing down on Critter’s head. If it senses danger however, i.e. a hand is approaching too quickly for comfort, <i>Critter's alarm turns into an expression of its own alarm.</i> It shrinks into its shell for safety, revealing the shell's jagged edges and making it even harder to turn off the alarm. Critter’s appearance and reactions serve to evoke empathy in those interacting with it, and force them to confront the ways in which they treat it.</p>

                                <p>Critter's responses are made possible due to a combination of sensors and motors, all controlled by a tiny computer called a microcontroller. Critter's "eyes" contain a distance sensor, which I use to calculate speed by getting the distance of a hand when it first appears, and then again as it’s coming down toward the head, and  dividing the difference of those distances with time.</p>

                    <h2>Adjusting and adapting plans</h2>
                    <p>I originally intended to use an LCD display to show the time on Critter's body, as seen in my sketches and electronics above. However, after printing the shell, I realized that the filament was still too opaque for the numbers to be legible. As I didn't have enough time to order new filament and reprint the shell, I pivoted in my design to make the LED strip, which I already had, function as a countdown display.  </p>

                    <h2>The next iteration</h2>
                    <p>One of my biggest mistakes in this iteration was underestimating the challenges of 3D printing, especially when running low on a valuable resource - time. With more time and a bigger budget, I would purchase transparent filament and remake Critter with a number display rather than the LED strip, which would remove the need for an external power supply and make Critter more portable.
