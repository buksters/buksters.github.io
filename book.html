                    <p>School libraries often have workspaces that serve as great study spots. During peak hours, however, finding an open space can be time and energy-consuming. The purpose of Book is to make finding a place to study less stressful for students.</p>

                    <!-- <h2>A workspace reservation app for easy availability checking and booking.</h2>   -->
                    <p>After interviewing several students, an issue that came to light was that it was especially hard to find workspaces to study as a group, with one of the contributing factors being that individual students often occupy group workspaces. Book mitigates this problem by automatically assigning users a workspace that accounts for their preferences and needs, matching solo students and groups to their respective intended study spaces. Additionally, an experimental feature of Book is the ability to make study groups "public" to other students when booking a group workspace, allowing other students to join. This streamlines the process of creating, scheduling, and finding study groups.</p>

If they choose a group workspace, they are given additional options for making the group public so that others can join. Additional fields only become visible once the user chooses to create a public group, so as to not clutter the screen for other users. Once they confirm their preferences, the system will find an open workspace that best matches, which users can review before making the booking.</p>
